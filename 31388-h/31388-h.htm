  To all who love the Children,
    This book, INSCRIBED, I bring,--
  Thus reaching forth to draw you
    Within my charmed ring,
  Where seeds and germs we'll nurture
    In babies, children, youth,
  Till every plant shall blossom,
    And bear the fruits of TRUTH.

INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<pre>
  Since little ones are <i>geese</i> no more,
    But <i>knowing</i> have become,
  It ill beseems that "Mother Goose"
    Should dwell in every home.
  So "Mother Truth" in "Melodies"
    For Babes, here lifts her voice,
  Assured that parents, children, all,
    Will welcome and rejoice.

<p>
Let no one suppose that the Author of these "Melodies" considers them
poetry. They are simply rhymes, the jingle of which may be music in
the children's ears, and the illustrations a delight to eager eyes.
The Truths presented, even if not fully understood at first, will
leave their impress, and in so far as they fill the little minds, will
keep out falsehood and false ideas.
</p>
<p>
The putting of facts in such form as to attract the attention of the
little ones, and be readily fixed in their memory, was first suggested
to the writer of these rhymes by a valued friend, the well known
philanthropist, MRS. ELIZABETH THOMPSON, and her interest in the
"Melodies" is such that she has generously assisted in procuring
illustrations for the same.
</p>
<p>
Thus "Mother Truth's Melodies" are introduced with the hope that this
effort to entertain children with rhyming reason will meet with the
approval of every lover of the young, and of Truth.
</p>
<a name="8">{8}</a>
<p>
Poetry is the language of the imagination, while "facts are stubborn
things," and, in the mass, refuse utterly to be poetized. Yet, even
facts may be presented pleasingly and melodiously, and in such way
that they will be easily impressed upon the minds of children. This
the author of "Mother Truth's Melodies" sought to do, when the little
book was first given to the public.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, in the revising and enlarging of the book, she has given
wider play to the imagination, has enlarged the range of subjects, has
embodied lessons for children of older growth, and feels that
altogether, it will meet more fully the demands which its already
large sales warrant her in believing to exist.
</p>
<p>
She can ask no more favorable reception than was first met; but,
hoping for a continuance of the same, she trusts that as it becomes
more widely distributed, its truths and teachings will be impressed
upon household after household, till throughout the land, the little
ones, and larger, too, shall be influenced thereby.

WHY FLY AWAY, MOTHER GOOSE?
</p>
<pre>
  "MOTHER GOOSE, Mother Goose,
    Why fly away?"
  "Because Mother Truth is
    A-coming to-day.
  She'll tell you funny things,
    But they'll be true;
  She'll bring you pictures
    So charming and new;
      She'll sing you Melodies, helping to show
      How, to true women and men, you may grow."

TOSS THE BABY.
</p>
<pre>
  Toss the baby high in air;
  Catch him though, with special care
  Lest his little back be strained,
  Lest his little joints be sprained,
  Lest his bones be bent or broken;

  Lest through life he bear some token
  Of a careless toss or fall,
  That for sympathy shall call,
  And that must forever be
  Painful to our memory.

    Mamma's boy,

  Roll it, and pick it and mark it with B,
    And toss in the oven for Baby and me.

  Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake,
    Papa's girl,
  Springing in baby-glee,

  If we give him nothing but smiles,
    He will give us never a frown-y.

  For with only half a try,

  And is getting cross, don't try
  To jingle bells, but hush-a-bye;
  All so still, now crooning low,
  Lull-a-bye, bye-o, bye-o,--
  Quiet down his quaking nerves,
  Soothe him as his state deserves;--
  Passing hand from head to feet,
  Sl-o-w-l-y, softly, loving, sweet,
  As to smooth the feathers down,
  Rumpled, from your birdling's crown;--  <a name="19">{19}</a>
  See, he sleeps, and in his dream
  Yours may hand of angel seem,
  Raveling out the tangled ills,
  Knitting up with restful thrills."

BABY'S RECORD.
</p>
<pre>
  New-born baby, soft and pink,
  Of the two worlds on the brink.

  One month old,--eat and sleep;
  Precious little human heap.

  Two months old,--tear and smile;
  Fists in mouth and eyes the while.

  Three months old,--"goo-a-goo,"
  Windows wide where soul looks through.

  Four months old,--finds his toes,
  Tries to fix them on his nose.   <a name="21">{21}</a>

  Five months old,--first wee pearl;
  All the household in a whirl.

  Six months old,--sits alone;
  Wishes swaddling clothes were gone.

  Seven months old,--creep and crawl,
  Wonder-eyed, a charm to all.

  Eight months old,--confiscate
  Pussy's tail and papa's pate.

  Nine months old,--roguish eyes
  Deepening daily; wilful, wise.

  Ten months old,--witching ways
  Wind us in; the baby pays!

  Eleven months old,--finger-tip
  Guides the elfin on his trip.

  Year old,--lots of mischief done;
  Walking, talking, just for fun.

NEVER TELL A FIB.
</p>

<pre>
  If mamma says she'll punish,
    She must do it, or she tells
  A fib, as Sister Annie
    Told "a story" 'bout the bells;
  And if mamma tells a fib,
    Then surely children will,
  And what a fearful thing,
    Our home with fibs to fill!

  Hush-a-bye, baby,

  Hush-a-bye, baby,
    And take a nice nap;
  Hush-a-bye, baby,
    What is it you say?
  Your "teeth are a-coming,"
  You're "ten months to-day;"
  Well, babies must cry,
  And Grandmothers must try
  To comfort and hush them, but never forget
    The little gums ache,
    And little nerves quake,
  Till little lips quiver, and babies must fret.

  Hush-a-bye, baby,
    We'll cool his hot gums,
  Hush-a-bye, baby,

  Hush-a-bye, baby,
    We'll rub hard and long
  With icy-cold finger,--
    See him list to my song!  <a name="27">{27}</a>

  Ah, babies are sweet
  If their wants we but meet,
  So why should we blame them when fretful and cross?
    Let us find what is wrong,

  And we'll see that time thus spent is never a loss.

    Nor trot you a mite,
    No matter how slight,

  Hush-a-bye, baby--

  We will <i>quiet his nerves</i>

  That brings with it soothing and comfort and rest;
  And to slumber so soft,
  His spirit we'll waft,
  And then lay him away in his own baby nest.

  Catches mice, in a trice,
  In everybody's barn.

  Look out for velvet paws,
  Do not trust them far,
  For velvet paws cover claws
  That will leave a scar.

  The oxen are such clever beasts,
    They'll drag the plough all day;
  They're very strong and tug along
    Great loads of wood or hay.

  They feed on grass, when green or dry;
    Their flesh is beef, for food;
  Their lungs are "lights," their stomach, "tripe,"
    Their skin for leather's good.

  Their hair men use in mortar, too,
    Lime, water, sand and hair,
  They nicely mix and smoothly fix,
    For plastering, so fair.

HARLEY'S DREAM.

<pre>
  I know a little brown-eyed boy,
    His name is Harley Hart;
  And with a naughty boy or girl,
    Our Harley has no part.

  He cons his lessons o'er and o'er,
    And once he fell asleep,
  With finger marking A, B, C,
    As 'twere the place to keep.

  And then he dreamed a funny dream--
    The page jumps up to dance,
  The letters laugh, and by and by,
    Like imps they leap and prance.   <a name="121">{121}</a>

  Now Harley oft had wondered whence
    The letters first had come;
  And I'm afraid he sometimes wished
    They all had staid at home,

  Instead of teasing him with quirks,
    And bothering him with names
  That seemed to help him hardly more
    In learning words than games.

  One little imp squeaked: "I am <i>A;</i>
    You could not be a man
  Without me." Then another cried:
    "I am E" and quickly ran,

  Exclaiming: "And without us both
    You could not have a h<i>e</i>ad."
  Another says: "You'd have no l<i>i</i>mbs
    If <i>I</i> were lost or dead."

  Then <i>O</i>, "You'd have no n<i>o</i>se nor t<i>o</i>es,
    If it were not for me;"
  "And what is more, were I not here,"
    Says <i>U</i>, "yo<i>u</i> could not be."   <a name="122">{122}</a>

  And thus they each and all lay claim
    To parcel and to part
  Of what he was, or what should do
    With hand, or head, or heart.

  They hung a ladder 'gainst the tree,
    And clambered up and down;
  They played a thousand pranks as wild
    As any gipsey clown.

  They whispered that they came from Rome,
    And that, if rightly placed,
  They'd serve our Harley with a feast
    A king would joy to taste.

  So when he woke and knew they were
    The little mystic keys
  That open Learning's gates so wide,
    He loved his A, B, C's.

<pre>
  I know a castle, curious,
    Of lovely form and make;
  That we may view the castle through,
    A hasty peep we'll take.   <a name="141">{141}</a>

  The framework of my castle proud,
    Is neither wood nor stone,
  But earthy matter mixed with lime
    And hardened into bone.

  This frame, of oddments is composed,--
    In mind, the number fix,--
  Of long and short and thick and thin,
    Two hundred just, and six.

  And these are fastened each to each,
    By hinges, like, or joints,
  Which, with an oil so soft and pure,
    The Builder wise, anoints.

  For garnishing this goodly frame,
    Quaint cushions, large and small,
  Are fitly fashioned, each in place,
   And pliant, one and all.

  For cushion covers, deftly wrought,
    A scarf so beautiful,
  So pinkish-white, so loose yet tight,
    So warm and yet so cool;

  Upon the smoothly rounded roof
    Is strewn the finest floss,
  A filmy veil, as soft as silk,--
    Or is it fairy moss?   <a name="142">{142}</a>

  Two windows hath this castle fair,
    That shut and open wide,
  With cords and pulleys, curtains fringed,
    And fixtures fine beside.

  These wondrous windows even smile
    And speak and fairly dance,
  And play at anger, hate, and love,
    And mischief, too, perchance.

  These windows, too, are marvelous
    In that they let the light
  Both in and out for him who dwells
    Within, the lordly knight.

    And ashes strewed within,
  If but the alley-ways are free,
    And outlets all a-kin.

  And stranger still, this castle comes
    And goes where'er the will
  Of him who holds the rule within
    Shall bid, his hest to fill.

  And wondrous more than all beside,
    This house the temple is,
  Of Him the great designer, God,--
    And "all the earth is his."

<pre>
  Now list, and of this castle grand
    A further tale we'll tell,
  In language plain, so plain that all
    May read and heed it well.

  The food we eat makes all our blood,
    And makes us children grow;
  And if we eat improper food
    It harms from top to toe.

  We all have teeth quite sharp and strong,
    With which to chew our food,
  And in the mouth are glands and glands--
    Yes, quite a numerous brood.

  These glands pour out saliva, free,
    To moisten what we eat
  And then a trap-door at the throat
    Performs a wondrous feat

  In guiding all the food along
    Into the Esophagus,
  And thence to stomach through a pass
    Called Cardiac Orifice.

  And here 'tis mixed with Gastric Juice,
    And into chyme is churned
  Then through the gateway, Pylorus,
    As wiser ones have learned.   <a name="146">{146}</a>

  'Tis in the Duodenum now,
    Where it is mixed with Bile,
  And with the Pancreatic juice,
    Which changes it to Chyle.

  This Chyle flows on, and all that's fit
    For nourishment and growth,
  Is taken up by Lacteals,
    Or "tubes with many a mouth."

  These lead to the Thoracic Duct,
    Which holds a spoonful large,
  And from this Duct a pipe proceeds
    Through which it may discharge.

  Into the great Sub-clavian vein,
    Which to the Heart doth lead,
  Whence it is sent into the Lungs,
    And into good blood made.

  Then back into the Heart it flows,
    The muscles there contract,
  And pump it into Arteries,
    Which wind to every part.

  We'd like to tell about the Bones,
    The Ribs and Vertebras,
  The Clavicle, or Collar-bone,
    Breast-bone, and Scapulae;   <a name="147">{147}</a>

  Of hinge, and ball-and-socket joints;
    Of muscles, tendons, skin,
  Of lungs and veins and arteries,
    Of nerves and heart and brain.

  But, Ah! we should your patience tire,
    Were we the whole to tell,
  So, waiting till another time,
    We bid you now, farewell.

LISTEN, CHILDREN!
</p>

<pre>
  Listen, children! when your head aches,
    Do not eat, but wait a meal;
  This will oftentimes relieve you,
    Making you right joyous feel.

  Listen, children! when your stomach
    Rolls and tumbles, wait awhile;
  Do not eat, but drink warm water,
    And you'll soon be glad and smile.

  Listen, children! in hot water
    Put your feet when you've "a cold;"
  Into bed now, wrapped in blankets,
    And you'll soon be well, we're told.

  Listen, children! perspiration
    Is a saving from much sin:
  Wash and rub, and dry well after;
    Thus we quell disease within.

  Listen, children! when you're hungry
    Do not stuff you like a pig,
  But eat slowly and chew thorough,
    Lest your teeth your grave shall dig.

<a name="167">{167}</a>

<pre>
  In the Solomon Group in the great Southern Sea,
    And on Isabel Island alone,
  A tree village is found, up the steep, rocky ground,
    On the top of a mountain of stone.

  So gigantic the trees that it is not with ease
    That the houses of natives are built,
  For the stems are six score of our feet, maybe more,
    And you'd think they must live on a stilt.

  By a ladder facade the ascent must be made,
    Formed of pliable trees, or a creeper
  Resembling the vine, which the natives entwine,--
    And the ladder's drawn up by the sleeper;

  For these houses are made but to sleep in, 'tis said,
    When some enemy threatens;--to guard
  'Gainst surprise in the night, they are fortified quite,
    With great stones, to be thrown at a pard.

  At the foot, of these trees are the day-huts for ease
    And for eating and dancing and play,
  Yet the huts up so high have a goodly supply
    Of the needful for night or for day.

  "WHAT is the Mammoth Cave?"

  Where fishes have no eyes nor sight,

    Of big rocks piled, or stone?--
  Now just suppose a door-way made,
    Or entrance to go in.   <a name="171">{171}</a>

  And when you're in, a path
    Leads on, right under ground,
  And by-and-by you come to a place
    Like a room with walls around.

  'Tis jagged and rough and rude,
    'Tis dark and damp as a grave,
  But whether 'tis large or small,
    'Tis always called a cave.

  Now, Mammoth means <i>monstrous big</i>,
    And the Mammoth cave, we claim
  As the largest known in the world,
    And that's what gives the name.

  And it has many a room,
    Quite large and wondrous grand,
  And it has springs and streams and lakes,
    All dark, you understand.

  And here are fishes, too,
    Yes, fishes with no eyes,
  That have lived in the dark for ages past,

  The Camels live in desert lands;
  Their feet are made to walk on sands;
  They carry burdens far and near,
  Where neither grass nor trees appear;

  Where there's no rain, no rivers, brooks,
  No water anywhere for folks;--
  But God has made in Camels' chest
  Peculiar sacs, for He knew best

  What they must do, and that they'd die,
  If He did not their drink supply.
  Before they start they drink and drink,
  Till every sac is full, I think;--

  And at the mouth of every sac,
  A muscle strong, but loose and slack,
  Will tighten up when it is filled,
  So that no drink can e'er be spilled.

  And when on journey, last or first,
  The camel wants to slake his thirst,
  A bag-string loosens, and out-pours
  Enough to satisfy for hours.

  In the sand-hill, see the openings,
    Round or oval odd-shaped, some,
  Size and form depending often,
    On how loose the sand become.

  When with their short bills they pecked it,
    Clinging fast with claws the while,
  Till they made an open door-way
    Suiting them in size and style.

  Once within, they peck and peck it,--
    Sometimes quite a yard or more,
  While the nest is snugly builded,
    Farthest from the outer door.

  But, so wise are they, this archway
    From the entrance to the nest,
  Is inclining ever upward,
    That no rain within may rest.

  So the pink-white eggs are laid there,
    Safe from harm, till baby-birds

    Known of every tribe and race;--
  Swift in flight, yet swinging, swaying,
    Skimming low from place to place.

  Parent-birds care less for young ones,
    Than do other swallow-kind;--
  Push them off half-fledged and timid,
    Each his food and home to find.

  Thus they, many a time, fall prey to
    Hawks and crows, their enemies;--
  Even the nest sometimes is entered
    By the snakes and fleas and flies.

  Swallows migrate in the Winter,

  The working bees might all be queens,
    If cared for and well-fed
  When they are in the larvae state,
    But they're half-starved instead,--

  While those intended for young queens
    Are fattened overmuch,
  And nursed and petted every hour,
    That they full growth may reach.

  For every different kind of egg
    That makes the different bees,
  A different kind of cell is made,
    The queen directing these.

  For drones or males, six-sided cells,
    Quite neat, and smooth, and nice;
  For working-bees a smaller cell,
    Uncouth, and rough, and coarse;
</pre>

  While those for queens are large and free,
    And fashioned fine with care,
  And lined with softest, silken shreds
    So daintily they fare.

  The queen-bee lays the worker-eggs,
    A dozen days, I ween,
  And then the drones as many more,
    Then workers, then the queen.

  Eggs, two or three, and sometimes four
    Are laid in worker-cell;
  While drones and queens have each but one,
    As oft is proven well.

  The bluish eggs so close and warm,
    Hatch out with three days passed;    <a name="199">{199}</a>
  When larvae, white, as little worms,
    Are watched and fed and nursed.

  These larvae, when some six days old,
    Close in their cells are shut,
  And there at once begin to weave
    A silken web about.

  They turn and twist till all around
    Themselves 'tis woven quite,
  And then they rest for twenty days,--
    'Tis such a pretty sight.

    The larger ones of drones,
  The large and plump and perfect ones
    Of all the coming queens.   <a name="200">{200}</a>

  In twenty days they now burst forth,
    Equipped from tip to toe,
  The working-bees and drones, I mean,
    For queens come forth more slow.

  The queen cocoons ope from behind,
    And I will tell you why,
  'Tis that the reigning queen may sting
    The others till they die.

  If mother queen leads off a swarm,
    A young queen they release,
  And she may take another swarm,
    And leave the hive in peace.

  Another queen is then let out,
    Perhaps a third and fourth,
  As many as can raise a swarm,
    To follow them, not loath;

<pre>
  But when no more can swarm and go,
    Because not bees enough,
  As I have said, the reigning queen
    Stings all the rest to death.

  For in each hive and everywhere,
    One queen alone will reign,
  And any interloper meets
    With sure and sharp disdain.

  Of workers, some are strong to fly,
    While some are weak and small,
  Unfitted quite, for load or flight,
    Or outside work at all.

  These last complete the larvae-cells,
    And nurse and feed the young;
  They mix the bee-bread, cleanse the hive,
    And care for every drone.

  All bees have stings except the drones,
    And these, when Autumn nears,
  Are stung to death with furious wrath,
    As by the book appears.   <a name="202">{202}</a>

  And now I hope you children all,
    Will use your wondrous power
  To "gather honey all the day,

HONEY-SWEET.
</p>

<pre>
  "Ah, but how do bees make honey?"
    Now the children, eager, ask;
  And we'll try to give them answer,
    If we're able for the task.

  See, the under-lip is lengthened,
    Like a trunk or proboscis,
  Ending by a kind of button,
    Fringed with tiny moving hairs.

  All along its length, too, fringes,
    Just the same, are growing forth;
  And by means of these, the honey
    Is conveyed from flowers to mouth.

  Then the bee has two small stomachs,
    In the first of which is stored
  All the honey it can gather,
    But, when home, 'tis quick out-poured.   <a name="206">{206}</a>

  Bees have six legs; and in hindmost,
    There are baskets found, or bags,
  Into which the pollen gathered,
    Is brushed off by the other legs.

  And this pollen, for the bee-bread
    And as food for young, they use,
  Mixed with honey and with water,--
   Swallowed and disgorged like juice

  By the nurses, who digest it
    Partly, for the larvae-food,
  Taking care that each shall have it,
    Just according to the brood.

  Now we'll watch and see them working;
    See them brush off pollen-dust;
  See them, too, disgorge the honey,
    Into cells the sweetness thrust.

  Children, with your useful fingers,
    Hands and arms and feet and head,
  Do not let the bees surpass you,
    Making honey, nay, nor bread.

  Children, you ought to know
    That <i>Grapho</i> can but mean
  To picture out, or tell about,
    Some object or some thing.

  Now <i>Geo</i> means the <i>earth</i>;
    And so Geography
  Means picturing out or telling about
    This earth of ours, you see.

  As <i>Phono</i> means a <i>sound</i>,
    Phonography so terse,
  Just pictures out or tells about
    The sounds of the human voice.   <a name="224">{224}</a>

  As <i>Photo</i> means the <i>light</i>,
    Photography must mean
  A picturing of the light that falls
    Upon a thing, I ween.

  Now <i>Astro</i> means the <i>stars</i>;
    And hence Astrography
  Means to describe or tell about
    The stars we all may see.

  And then Astronomy
    Tells all the various laws
  That govern or relate to stars;
    Of their motions tells the cause.

  Now <i>Bios</i> means a <i>life</i>;
    And so Biography
  Means writing out the life of one,
    Which we may often see.

  <i>Zoos</i> means <i>animal</i>;
    And your Zoography
  Describes the animals that live
    On land or in the sea.   <a name="225">{225}</a>

  Then there's Stenography,
    A writing narrow, small,
  Or, as so many call it now,
    "Short-hand," which tells it all.

  And then Xylography--
    Engraving upon wood;
  And Crystallography as well,
    That tells of crystals good.

  But these are <i>ographies</i>
    Enough for now, you think;
  Yet when you're older, wiser grown,
    You many more will link.

LITTLE MISCHIEF.
</p>

<pre>
  Little Master Mischief
    Lives in Nellie's eye,
  Sitting in the corner,
    Peeping out so sly;
  Now he's crossed the snow-ground
    And in chamber blue,
  Thinking he is hidden,
    Peek-a-boos at you.

  Now he drops the curtain,
    Sure that he is hid,
  But you see him dancing
    Even on the lid.
  Now, the curtains lifting,
    You can see he's crept
  To the inner chamber,
    Where the love-light slept.

  Watching now his moment
    He pops out, and see,
  Mamma's spools and thimble
    Quickly disagree.

  When she had arranged them?
    Would she think it fair?
  Would she like her puzzle
    Portions of it, lost?
  Would she like her dishes
    Everywhere uptossed?
  Would she like her apron
    With a missing string,
  Mamma hunting, meanwhile,
    Thread and everything?

  Nellie, learn the lesson:
    Be to others true,
  Always do as you would
    Have them do to you.   <a name="232">{232}</a>

  This the dear Lord's precept,--

  Grandma loves her birdy,
    And when he gaily sings,
  She will laugh and chat with him,
    At which he hops and springs.

  Fearing though, that birdy
    Might not understand,
  Grandma from the toy-shop,
    Brought a whistle grand.

  Tuning now the whistle,
    To his sweet bird-note,
  He in singing back to her,

  Birdy, free outflying,
    Often comes to light
  On Grandma's tip-of-finger
    Or chair-back, pretty sight!

  From her hand she feeds him,
    And he oft will take
  From her mouth the sugar,
    With a merry shake.

  Yester-morn the window
    Being open wide,
  Birdy thought it brighter
    On the outer side.

  Grandma mourning sadly,
    Shed of tears a few,
  Then she prayed the Father,
    "Show me what to do."

  Soon she set his cage out
    On the window-sill,
  Saying, "Birdy'll come now,
    Oh, I'm sure he will!"   <a name="235">{235}</a>

  Then she, hopeful, praying,
    "Bring my birdy home,"
  Took the sweet bird-whistle,
    Playing "Birdy, come."

  And the birdy hearing,
    Quickly came and lit
  On the cage, and shortly
    Flitted into it.

  Thankful now was Grandma,
    To the dear Lord, who,
  Listening to her prayer
    Taught her what to do.

  Over in the meadow where the men make hay,
  In an elm-tree shadow on a bright summer day,
  Two speckled quails ponder as to what will be best,
  Should the stout mower blunder on their pretty home-nest.

  But a cloud in a minute from her great white bed
  Threw a big silver bonnet o'er the sun's golden head
  And the quails, though they wondered would their home be beset,
  Cried aloud, and it thundered: "More wet! more wet!"   <a name="239">{239}</a>

  Then the great sturdy yeoman coming close to the nest,
  With the heart of a true man beating soft in his breast,
  Saw the parent-quails watching, with what fear who can tell?
  Saw the baby-quails hatching, hardly out of the shell.

  And who knows but he thought of his own precious baby
  His dear little daughter in her mother's arms, maybe?
  For he quickly made over that portion of meadow
  With the sweetest of clover, and the softest of shadow.

  To the quails who all summer lived alongside the lane,
  Ever warning the farmer of the forth-coming rain;
  For long ere it thundered and I hear the cry yet
  They would call as they wandered, "More wet! More wet!"

IT SNOWS! IT SNOWS!

  It snows! yes, it snows! and the children are wild,
  At thought of the fun in the snow-drifts up-piled;
  The boy with his first new boots is in sight,
  And the wee baby-girl, with her mittens so bright.
  They are tramping and tossing the snow as they run,
  And laughing and shouting, so brimful of fun;
  While the ten-year-old twins, in a somersault mood,
  Have measured their length from the barn to the wood.
  A dozen times, yes, or it may be a score,
  Till their cheeks are as red as the roses, and more;
  Then the elfin of twelve and the boy of fifteen,
  Are pelting each other with snowballs so keen,
  That we, who are older, forget to be staid,    <a name="245">{245}</a>
  And shout, each with each, as the youngsters, arrayed
  In feathery garments, press on or retreat,
  Determined to win, nor acknowledge defeat,
  And the snow tumbles down with such beauty and grace
  That the air seems filled up with soft, bridal-veil lace,
  Through whose meshes the sunbeams shall kiss Mother Earth,
  Till the buds and the blossoms are bred into birth.
  But the children, at length, tired out with their play,
  And stamping the snow from their feet by the way,
  Come slipping and stumbling and scrambling along,
  While the big brother catching the baby-girl's song,
  "Oh, my finders are told!" gives her now a gay toss,
  The golden hair streaming like distaff of floss;
  And so cheery the group that is ranged round the board,
  That for snow, blessed snow! we all thank the good Lord.

    "If you'll break the first brake

    Taught us grand-bairns one by one;
  And the lesson relished keenly
    Filled each spring-time full of fun.

  For the watchful eyes were eager,
    And the flying feet must roam
  Till they every nook beleaguer
    Round the old ancestral home.

* * * * *

  But 'twas not the broken brakelet
    That wrought good for after years;
  Not the killing of the snakelet,
    But the conquering of fears,

  And the patient, wistful watching,
    Educating thought and eye,
  Made the brakelet and the snakelet
    Types of weal for bye and bye.

     Let us doff shoes and stockings,
     (Ah! naught gave us shockings),

  Aye, barefooted run o'er the leas."

     And mother, so wise,
     Looking into our eyes,--    <a name="249">{249}</a>
 "There's a snowdrift down under the hill!

     Yes, when you will fling me
     A dandelion blossom
     To wear on my bosom
  You may barefooted run as you will,
  Aye, barefooted run as you will."

     So for "guineas of gold,"
     O'er the dandelion-wold,
  We hunted afar and anear;
     And with shouts of delight

  Neat and nice to form the "tie."
  Now our Elzie, large and fine,
  Looks like twelve, though only nine--
  And the "tie" when quite complete,
  Was so small, though choice and neat,
  That it could not be denied,
  Elzie was not satisfied.
  So she shook her curly head,
  As with curious smile she said:
  "If I were a <i>little</i> girl,
  Like Nannette or Cousin Pearl,
  This wee 'tie' might then appear
  Just the thing,--but now, I fear,
  Looking at the 'tie' and me,
  We shall seem to disagree.--

  Now, Mamma, don't answer quick;
  Stop and think,--my snowy Dick
  At the Fair might win some pence,
  By his wise obedience;
  And his pretty winsome ways
  Being shown through all the days;--
  And, dear Mamma, then I should
  Feel I'd done the best I could."

  Quickly Mamma took the thought,
  And a royal cage was brought;
  Cushion made of scarlet bright,--
  For our Dicky, pure and white,
  Thus was wont to perch and sit,--
  And a collar blue we fit
  To his neck, when loyal, true,
  He presents red, white, and blue.

  So the cage is placed within
  A sly corner, free from din,
  And with tickets five cents each,
  Elzie sought her end to reach.

  "Handsome Dick! weight fifteen pounds"--
  Whispers Elzie on her rounds;
  "What is 'Handsome Dick'?" they say;
  "Come and see, please,--step this way;"

  And once seen they're glad to tell
  Others of white Dick, as well;--
  For the cat, as knowing now
  He must make his courtliest bow.   <a name="265">{265}</a>

  Did his best to help along
  Elzie's plan, the friends among.
  Upon his cushion he would stand,
  Or sit, as Elzie might command;
  Then down upon his blanket lie
  And be wrapped up like baby-bye;
  Would lap his milk, or dainty, sip,
  And shake his pretty under-lip,
  Thus showing teeth as white as pearl,--
  Then round and round would quickly whirl,
  Till each one seeing, cheerful, said:
  "For that five cents I'm sure we're paid."

  Thus the three days passing by,
  Which the Fair must occupy--
  Dollars ten--ah, yes! and more,
  Elzie holds within her store!
  Dues for cage and tickets met,
  And the <i>ten</i> is Elzie's yet,--
  Which unto the Fair she gave
  With an air so joyful-grave,
  That it seemed a spirit bright,
  Nestled in her heart so light;--
  And a happier child than she,
  We may never hope to see.

NANNY'S PLAY.
</p>

<pre>
  Our Nanny helped her mother
    In many a childish way,--
  She picked up chips to feed the fire,
    And "played that it was play."

  She loved the hens and chickens
    And fed them day by day,
  And dubbed them each with quaintest name,
    And this was always play.

  She hunted through the big barn
    For hens' nests in the hay,
  And fetched the eggs right carefully,
    And this again was play.

  She donned her mother's dust-cap
    And danced about so gay,
  And planned how she would house-keep,
    And this was "truly play."

    She fluttered like a fay;
  The broken cup soon told her
    'Twas anything but play.   <a name="271">{271}</a>

  She romped around the hay-field
    And shook the new-mown hay,
  And with her baby-rake she gleaned
    The meadow for her play.

  She ran to pick the berries
    That ripened by the way,
  And with her basket full to brim
    This was the best of play.

  So many things, so many,
    Far more than I can say,
  Our Nanny in her childhood
    Has "played that it was play."

  Our Nanny was but four years old
    When mother said, "My love,
  Your needle learn with skill to use,
    It will a blessing prove."

  So Nanny learned to "overhand,"
    And "hem" so fine and neat,
  To "backstitch," "run," and many a join
    That she could scarce repeat.   <a name="273">{273}</a>

  She learned to "catch-stitch" and to "cross,"
    To "patch" and "darn," as well,
  To "gather," "plait," "box-plait" and "side,"
    To "feather-stitch" and "fell."

  She sewed the buttons fast, and "worked
    The buttonholes" so neat,
  That many an eld accomplishes
    With less success, the feat.

  "Be sure your thread is smooth and strong,
    A goodly knot or two,
  A double stitch for first, and then
    A fastening sure when through;

  "And thus your seams will never rip,
    Your sewing never wear,--
  Like buttons loose and hooks awry,--
    A slip-shod, shiftless air."

  All this and more her mother taught,
    And Nanny conned it o'er
  Till she was versed in all the arts
    That point the seamster's lore.

  You'll keep them ranged so neat and nice,

  "A place for this, a place for that,
    Each garment grouped aright,
  That you may lay your little hand
    Upon it, day or night.

  "No garment must be laid within,
    Except it ready be,
  To don and wear, for thus you spare

NANNY'S RIDE.
</p>

<pre>
  Our Nanny oft in fancy
    Soared up, the earth above,
  And sailed the great air-ocean
    With skylark or with dove.

  And in this fashion musing,
    One sunny summer's day,
  Half-watching mother mending
    And baby-brother play,
</pre>

<p class="figure">

<pre>
  Without a word of warning
    The old umbrella came,
  Opened upside down before her,
    And whispered soft her name.   <a name="277">{277}</a>

  "Come, Nanny you've been longing
    For a ride, and now's your time:
  Jump in,--be quick! And careful, too,
    For I'm o'erpast my prime."

  So, springing in, she sat there
    As happy as you please,
  And through the open window,
    Was borne upon the breeze.

  The sparrows eyed her keenly,
    The doves left off their cooing,
  And children, cause they couldn't go,
    Set up a grand boo-hoo-ing.

  And next she got entangled
    In the telegraphic wires;
  And when she jerked away from them,
    She bumped against the spires.

  She hit the tallest chimneys,
    And set the smoke a-curling,
  Then knocked a flag-pole all awry,
    The stars and stripes a-whirling.

  Now, far beyond the city,
    With mountains in her face,
  An eagle pounced to catch her,
    But she quickly won the race.

  Dear children, you are sometimes led
    To sorrow, sin, and woe,             <a name="289">{289}</a>
  Because you have not courage quite,
    And dare not answer, No.

  When playmates tell you this, or that
    Is "very nice to do,"
  See first what mamma says, or if
    You think 'tis wrong, say No.

  Be always gentle, but be firm.
    And wheresoe'er you go,
  If you are asked to do what's wrong,
    Don't fear to answer, No.

  False friends may laugh and sneer at you.
    Temptations round you flow,
  But prove yourself both brave and true,
    And firmly tell them, No.

  Sometimes a thing that's not a sin,
    You might be asked to do,--
  But when you think it is not best,
    Don't yield, but answer, No.

  True friends will honor you the more,
    Ah, yes, and false ones too,
  When they have learned you're not afraid
    To stand and answer, No.   <a name="290">{290}</a>

  And when temptations rise within,
    And plead to "come," or "go,"
  And do a wrong for "_just this once_"
    Be sure you answer, No.

  For when you once have done a Wrong,
    The Right receives a blow,--
  And Wrong will triumph easier now,
    So haste and answer, No.

  There's many a little boy and girl,
    And man and woman too,
  Have gone to ruin and to death
    For want of saying, No!

  So, young or old, or great or small,
    Don't fail, whate'er you do,
  To stand for Right and nobly dare
    To speak an honest No.

  In the Talmud you will find it,--
    In the quaint and curious lore
  Of the ancient priests, or Rabbins,
    Whom the people bowed before;

  Find the story of an infant
    Sitting on the kingly knee;
  "Little Moses," Pharaoh calls him,--
    Crowing loud in baby glee.   <a name="295">{295}</a>

  And the banqueters were cheering,
    When the infant with a spring,
  Reached and caught the crown that rested
    Upon Pharaoh's head, as king.

  Caught the crown, and quickly placed it
    On his own unwitting head;
  But the king and all his princes,
    In the deed a meaning read.

  Then spake Balaam, the magician,
    "Not because the child is young,
  Hath he done this thing unknowing;--
    He hath mocked thee, he hath flung

  "In thy face thy kindly dealings;
    Such hath ever been the way
  Of his people; a usurper--
    Let his blood be spilled this day."

  But the winsome baby-fingers
    Toying with the kingly beard,
  Won the edict: "Call the judges;
    Let their counselings be heard."   <a name="296">{296}</a>

  So the judges and the wise men
    Came with Jethro, Midian's priest,
  Who, with wish to save young Moses,
    Thus his majesty addressed:

  "If it to the king be pleasing,
    Fetch two plates, and we will hold
  Them before the babe, a-brimming,
    One with fire, and one with gold.

  "If the child shall grasp the golden,
    He hath done this knowingly;
  He will trample on thy statutes;
    For thine honor he must die.

  "But if he shall grasp the other,
    Know, O King, he knoweth nought
  Of a royal crown or scepter,--
    And his life with fire is bought."

  These wise words, the king approving,
    Plate of fire and plate of gold,
  Courtiers brought, and screams of anguish,
    Soon the childish choosing told.   <a name="297">{297}</a>

  For he, baby-like, had thrust it
    In his mouth; and though he flung
  Quick the coal, he ever after
    Spake with slow and stammering tongue.

    On which you children speed
  To a land of light and plenty,
    Or a land of darksome need;
  And soon you'll come to a meadow,
    Where two tracks mark the way,
  But they'll run close up alongside
    For many and many a day.

  And one is strewn with roses,
    While one looks bleak and bare,
  With now and then a berry-bush,
    And a violet here and there;--     <a name="299">{299}</a>

  On one you'll find companions
    Who but for pleasure seek,
  While friends along the other,
    Will words of wisdom speak.

  Be careful in your choosing,
    For if you take the <i>Right</i>,
  You will travel in the shadow
    Of the Rock that shields at night;
  'T will lead through greenest pastures
    Where softest brooklets flow,
  And land you at a Station
    That is full of cheer and glow.   <a name="300">{300}</a>

  On the other track, the roses
    Are backed by sharpest thorns;
  While berries always nourish,
    And the violet but adorns;--
  You will stumble into sluices,
    And what is worse than all,
  Your self-respect and conscience
    Grow weak with every fall.

  Yes, if you choose the other
    That looks so bright and gay,
  You'll find the bridges broken,
    And the road-bed washed away;
  And when you near the Station,
    You'll switch to a fearful leap,
  That will hurl you into darkness,
    And bury you in the deep.

  But those who choose the Right one
    Grow manly, womanly, true;
  God's love-light shines upon them,
    And falls as heavenly dew;--
  They grieve at your wild folly,
    And will gladly help you back,
  If at any curve or turning
    You seek the trusty track.

  But ah! the scars you're wearing,
    From thorns that pierced you sore,--   <a name="302">{302}</a>
  And the ditches in which you've fallen,
    That were strewn with roses o'er;--
  And the joys you've lost, unnumbered,
    That spring from good deeds done;
  And the fruits you've missed, unmeasured,
    That by others have been won.

  Though friends may be indulgent,
    And loved ones even forget,
  Yourself can never banish
    The memories that beset.
  You will wish you had never traveled
    The way that leads to death;
  You will wish you had never reveled
    In the viper's venomed breath.

  So beware which track you follow;
    And again I say, beware!
  The <i>False</i> is strewn with roses,--
    The <i>True</i> looks bleak and bare;
  But this, 't is plain, is only
    That youthful, artless eyes
  Are open to show and glamour,
    But see not deep nor wise,   <a name="303">{303}</a>

  To Truth then, children, listen,
    And cultivate the seed
  That in your hearts God planted,
    To serve your every need;--
  Yes, heed the voice within you,
    And follow it all the way,
  For it will help you choose the road
    That leads to endless day.

THE PHOEBE'S NEST IN THE OLD WELL-WHEEL.

  "Phoe-be, phoe-be," why, 'tis a little bird,
  "Phoe-be, phoe-be," singing the pretty word;
  "Phoe-be, phoe-be," brown feathers cover him,
  Gray breast, with blackish stripes scattered all over him.

  "Phoe-be, phoe-be," here comes his little mate,
  "Phoe-be, phoe-be," both on the garden gate,
  "Phoe-be, phoe-be," loving now they trill,
  Planning to build a nest in the old well-wheel.

  "Phoe-be, phoe-be," now the nest is begun;
  "Phoe-be, phoe-be," now it is nearly done;
  "Phoe-be, phoe-be," how will the birdies feel,
  When the egg is dropped down, with turn of the wheel.

  "Phoe-be, phoe-be," children are sorry now,
  "Phoe-be, phoe-be," birds are all a-worry now,
  "Phoe-be, phoe-be," laying eggs day by day,
  While the turn of the wheel ever drops them away.   <a name="305">{305}</a>

  "Phoe-be, phoe-be," never the lesson learned,
  "Phoe-be, phoe-be," year by year they returned,
  "Phoe-be, phoe-be," building persistently,
  Where the turn of the wheel dropped the eggs all away.

  Phoe-be, phoe-be, yet not in vain you wrought,
  Phoe-be, phoe-be, for, by your folly taught,
  Phoe-be, phoe-be, children plan so to build,
  That no eggs may be lost by the turn of life's wheel.

MABEL'S SNOW-FEATHERS.

  Listen, children, while I tell you
    What our merry Mabel said
  When she saw the feathery snow-flakes
    Tumbling down about her head.

  Clapping hands and dancing gaily,
    "Mamma, mamma, come and see!
  Come and see the feathers, mamma,
    Soft and white as they can be!"   <a name="307">{307}</a>

  Standing then a moment, pondering
    As it were, whence came the snow,
  Little face so wise and thoughtful,
    Mabel cried: "Oh, now I know,

  "There are lots of eider ducklets
    Up in Heaven, above the blue,
  And they're dropping off their feathers,--
    And such downy feathers, too!

  "See them frolic with each other;
    See them kiss as fast they fly;
  See them make believe they are going to,
    Then go gaily flitting by.

  "See them on the Spruce and Balsam,
    Pile up little soft, fat hands;
  See their many plump, white cushions;
    See them wave their fairy wands.

  "See the showers of flying feathers
    Whisking 'round in merry moods;
  See, the telegraph their perch is,--
    Oh, I'm sure they're almost birds!"   <a name="308">{308}</a>

  Now she fancies she can hear them
    Whisper of their ducklet birth;--
  Hear their soft and wean-y quacklings,
    As they tumble down to earth.

  Now she listens for the jingle
    Of the sleigh-bells they will bring;
  Now she sees the flying horses,
    Prancing gaily at their ring.

  Lovely are these fleecy feathers,
    Dainty in each rare device;
  All unlike our ducklet feathers,--
    White and soft, but cold as ice.

  Children, have you seen the budding
    Of the trees in valleys low?
  Have you watched it creeping, creeping
    Up the mountain, soft and slow?
  Weaving there a plush-like mantle,
    Brownish, grayish, red-dish green,
  Changing, changing, daily, hourly,
    Till it smiles in emerald sheen?

  Have you watched the shades so varied,
    From the graceful, little white birch,
  Faint and tender, to the balsam's
    Evergreen, so dark and rich?
  Have you seen the quaint mosaics
    Gracing all the mountain-sides,
  Where they, mingling, intertwining,
    Sway like softest mid-air tides?   <a name="311">{311}</a>

  Have you seen the autumn frostings
    Spread on all the leafage bright,
  Frostings of the rarest colors,
    Red and yellow, dark and light?
  Have you seen the glory painted
    On the mountain, valley, hill,
  When the landscape all illumined,
    Blazons forth His taste and skill?

  Have you seen the foliage dropping,
    Tender cling, as loth to leave
  Mother-trees that taught them deftly,
    All their warp and woof to weave?
  Have you seen the leafless branches
    Tossing wildly 'gainst the blue?
  Have you seen the soft gray beauty
    Of their wintry garments' hue?

  Have you thought the resurrection
    Seen in Nature year by year,
  Is a symbol of our rising
    In a higher, holier sphere?
  Children, ye are buds maturing;
    Make your autumn rich and grand,
  That your winter be a passage
    Through the gates to Glory-land.

  The twilight gray is falling,
    Now list and you shall hear
  The footsteps of the sylphid fays,--
    This is their hour of cheer.

  List to the gentle patter
    On each wee blade of grass,
  As it is bent, and back again,
    Whene'er the fairies pass.   <a name="313">{313}</a>

  Upon the tips of grasses
    They cross the meadows, lawn,
  And laugh and dance and play and sing,
    From twilight hour till dawn.

  They light their myriad lanterns,
    And hang them in the arch
  Of blue that canopies o'erhead,
    And by their light they march.

  They sometimes miss a fairy,
    And take a lantern down
  To search for her, and mortals say;
    "A fire-fly flits around."

  On leaves they hang their diamonds,
    Their pearls in every flower;
  Their gauzy veils upon the grass,
    They spread for fairy bower.

  Their slender wings are hanging
    On every shrub, across;
  Their seats are dainty cushion-beds
    Of green and springy moss.   <a name="314">{314}</a>

  Their shrubbery of coral
    Is gray and scarlet-tipped;
  Their hair upon the maize is hung
    Each Summer, when 'tis clipped.

  The mushroom forms their table,
    Their dishes, acorn cups;
  The ant-hills are their barracks high;
    Their cannon, "hemlock pops."

  Their scarfs of plush are lying
    On ripening grape and peach;
  Their sea-shells 'neath the apple trees,
    Each Spring bestrew their beach.

  They paint the leaves in Autumn;
    They make a tiny rink
  Of every puddle, fen, and dike,
    And skate from nave to brink.

  They brown the nuts in forests,
    The burrs they open wide;
  They lure the feathers from the clouds.
    And pile them up, to slide.

  They build along the way-side
    Their fairy palisades,--
  The "hoar-frost" some have christened it,--
    And hold West Point parades.

  They sketch upon the windows
    Such pictures as no power
  Of man can ever execute,
    And on them pearl-dust shower.   <a name="316">{316}</a>

  All these and myriad fancies
    That never can be told,
  My childhood days so new and sweet,
    In memory infold.

  But mother softly whispers,
    "Tis not the Fays, my dears,
  Tis old Dame Nature's song of songs,
    The 'Music of the Spheres.'

  "List ever for it, children,
    Twill bring you close to God;
  Each sound but echoes Him who made,
    Each motion is His nod."

  If you let your fiery temper
    And your own will govern you;
  And they told me 'even Jesus
    Said, 'Thy will, not mine, be done,'

    All my life I can but mourn.

  And they told me, too, dear mamma,
    That if I were called to die,
  I could not be glad in heaven,

  Now, what shall I do, dear mamma,

  That will tell you every moment,

  But you must not disobey it,

    Hurry when you hear it speak.

  "For if you should linger waiting,
    There's another voice will say:
  Never mind, nobody'll know it,

  And this other voice, this Tempter,
    Sure will lead you to the wrong,
  While the voice of the good angel

  "In your play and in your working,
    You the Golden Rule must heed;
  Do by others as you'd have them
    Do by you, if in their stead.
  Better far to <i>bear</i> and <i>suffer</i>

  Better give up every pleasure,
    Than to be by sin beguiled.

  "In your eating, in your drinking,
    In your clothing, in your talk,
  You can glorify the Father,
    Or in wickedness can walk.
  For your little body, Lizzie,
    God has said, 'Keep holy, pure,'   <a name="321">{321}</a>
  Tis His 'temple' He has lent you,
    Keep its every gate secure,

  "What you eat and drink makes muscles,
    Bones and nerves, and brain, and thought;
  And by food and drink improper,
    Fearful evils may be wrought.
  Much of meat and spice and candies,
    Makes your blood impure, and then
  All your body's in a jangle,
    And your temper's wild again.

  "And your clothes if tight or heavy,
    Help to make your blood impure;
  Help to make you weak and wicked,
    Into evil ways to lure.
  Foul air, too, your blood will poison
    Sitting up too late at night;
  All these things will make it harder
    For you, child, to do the right.

  "Bad companions also lead you
    To the wrong, and tempt you sore
  To defy the voice within you
    Till it, grieved, will speak no more,--   <a name="322">{322}</a>
  Do not hesitate to tell them
    You cannot their ways approve.
  Do not yield to their enticements;
    Tell them 'No!' with firmness, love.

  "Do not ever let a single
    Word unkind, nor coarse, impure,
  Pass your lips; for these will lead you
    Toward the bad, you may be sure.
  Do not let a playmate tell you
    Anything that must be kept
  As a secret from your mother;--
    Something's wrong, so don't accept.

  "Always tell a thing precisely
    As it is; don't try to make
  It more fine and entertaining;
    Tell the truth for Truth's dear sake.
  Never lay a finger, darling,
    On what is not quite your own,
  Lest temptation overtake you,
    And your honesty be gone.

  "In the silence of your chamber,
    When no human being's nigh,     <a name="323">{323}</a>
  Don't forget that God is with you,
    Watching with all seeing-eye;
  Don't forget that He will know it
    If you do a thing that's wrong;
  Keep yourself so pure and perfect,
    That your life shall be His song.

  "Now, dear child, the blessed Jesus
    Always, when you wish it, hears,
  Giving help to those who ask it,
    Lightening woes, and lessening fears.
  Follow always His example;
    Take His precepts for your guide;
  Learn to trust Him, for He's walking
    Ever loving at your side."

    And 'tis cold to cross the moor
  In their tattered garments few;
    Mamma, may I give the new?"

  "No, my child, and yet you may
    Sometimes give new things away.
  Keep your pennies, and they'll be
    Dollars, by and by, two, three;
  Thus you now and then may have
    Something new and fresh to give."

THE LITTLE STREET-SWEEPER.

<pre>
  Look at that little girl sweeping the crossing;
  See how the mud her bare legs is embossing!
  And her feet are so slippered with mud, that it seems
  As though from the ground she grew up 'mongst the teams;
  And why she's not run over surely's a wonder,
  Standing there sweeping, the horses' feet under.
  See her close curls and her bright, beaming eye;
  Though fearless, the glance, you perceive, is half shy,   <a name="333">{333}</a>
  As so lightly she swings her wet broom, and so true,--
  Let us cross, and we'll give her a penny or two.

  But wait, now a passer-by hands her a penny;
  Just see her bright glance twinkle over to Benny,
  The little hunchback sitting there on the curb-stone,
  Close up to the lamp-post, that he may disturb none.
  His crutches beside him a sorry tale tell;
  But see, he's a basket of knick-nacks to sell;
  And a lady has bought for her child a toy whip,
  And now from her port-monaie gives him the scrip,
  But refuses the change,--and with tears in his eyes,
  He thanks her and blesses, with grateful surprise;--
  And the glance the boy now flashes over to Jenny,
  Is as bright as she gave him when she got the penny.
  O, I've seen them so many times! always together,
  Always happy and cheery, in bright or dull weather;
  For though he makes the most when it's fair, as they show me,
  Yet she does the best when it's muddy and stormy.

  Watch, now, her quick smile of such pleased recognition:--
  To win it I oft come this way on my mission.
  But see, she draws back as I offer the penny,     <a name="334">{334}</a>
  And modestly says, "Madam, please keep the money,
  For you know 'tis a pleasure to me to be sweeping
  The path for you, lady;" and, all the time keeping
  Her broom just before us to brush the least speck,
  The sweet smiles in her eyes her whole being bedeck.
  So I keep it, for she has as good claim as I
  To the right to do favors and none will deny
  That "It is more blessed to give than receive,"
  And her sweep is far more than my pennies to give.
  But we'll stop and see Benny, and make it up there,
  For in all that each gets they will both have a share.
  A nice little bib for my baby at home,--
  A patent tape-measure, a mother-pearl comb;
  And Benny's pale face lightens up with a glow
  Such as angels rejoice in;--now, Maud, we must go.
  But to Benny: "I'm thinking to-night I may come
  And bring my friend with me, to see your new home."
  "O, if you will!" says the child with delight
  Rippling over his face like a sunbeam--and quite
  As joyously, Jenny: "O, madam, please do,
  For we've something at home that we want to show you!"

  So when 'tis near night-fall we take the short car    <a name="335">{335}</a>
  That off through West Fourth Street goes winding afar,
  And away to the Hudson, almost, we shall find
  A lone-seeming tenement cuddled behind
  Huge heaps of fresh lumber so piney and sweet,
  While everything round there is charmingly neat.--
  Yes, the children are home and as gay as a lark,
  While the good mother greets us with pleasure;--but hark!
  A baby-cry comes from the bedroom beyond,
  And Jenny brings forth a sweet, sunny-haired blonde,
  Saying: "This is the something we wanted to show you,
  This two-years-old baby-girl--why, does she know you?
  She holds out her hands to go to you so soon!"
  "Ah! she feels we are friendly;--hear now her soft croon.
  But how came she here, child?" "We found her just over
  The lumber-yard fence, with a board for a cover,
  Wrapped up in a blanket marked Bertha." "But why
  Do you not to the charity mission apply?"
  "O, we want her ourselves! And the good Lord, through you,  <a name="336">{336}</a>
  Has given us this home, so what else should we do,
  Than to keep what He sends? And we're sure He sent Berty,
  In place of our baby that died, little Myrtie!"

  And here these poor people, so poor they were starving
  When I found them a few months ago, were now halving
  Their food and their home with this waif and with Benny--
  For he was an orphan child left by his granny,
  Who died in an attic just over their room,
  In the tumble-down house they before-time called home;
  Though they've four of their own, and the eldest is Jenny,
  The little street-sweep who would not take the penny,
  Yet they say, "Benny seems quite as much to belong here,
  And be one of our children, as if he were born here."

  O, how many rich homes where no child is given,
  Might be made, for poor orphans, an opening to Heaven!    <a name="337">{337}</a>
  And how many, poorer, might seem to be rich,
  With a benny or Bertha to fill up the niche
  That is left 'neath the hundreds of home-roofs all over.
  Which the Lord has designed some poor orphan shall cover;
  For He makes His home where His children are moored,--
  And brings in His wealth where they live by His word;
  And the meal and the oil there shall never be spent;--
  What we give to the poor, to the Lord we have lent.
  A baby to feed, is a baby to love,
  A child in the house, "a well-spring" from above,--
  And never forsaken, and ne'er begging bread,
  Shall be those who take care that His lambs are well fed.
